# The Game of Nim in Haskell

## My first haskell program

For more information on the game, you can check out the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim).


## Thanks

Once I put this up, I got some good feedback on improving my Haskell. Yay!

* [Harry Garrood](https://twitter.com/hdgarrood) for the tip on using traverse for printing a list of strings.
* [Justin Campbell](https://twitter.com/justincampbell) for the tips on using iterate for star line creation and reminding me that is_winning_board can just = all (==0) rather than including the argument explicitly.
